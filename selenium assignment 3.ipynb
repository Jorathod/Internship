THE MOST IMPORTANT THING: We are always happy to see you at our place! :)\", \"Hostelle is the first and only all-women hostel in London. Hostelle was started with the idea to provide a safe and fun place for women who are traveling to Amsterdam, Barcelona, or London to stay so that they only need to focus on sightseeing and enjoying themselves while they are here. For women travelers with a small budget Hostelle is ideal, we are very well communicated with the airport and the city center. London has a lot of different attractions and interesting places to visit. Because there are so many options, we from Hostelle have made a list of the absolute must-visits in London. Hyde Park: Hyde Park is presumably the foremost notable park in London, it’s among the biggest. The park has historical significance, having hosted a variety of demonstrations and protests together with protests by suffragettes. The park hosts many performances weekly in addition to activities like paddle-boating, seeing several swans, and taking in a breath of fresh air in the center of the city. A must-visit. Westminster: Westminster is home to the Houses of Parliament and the world-famous Big Ben. Big Ben is the name of the bell housed within the iconic clock tower, and it still chimes every hour. You can also find Westminster Abbey here, which is open to the public most days. Whilst visiting these landmarks, be sure to rest your feet in Parliament Square which features statues of important political individuals including Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill. Camden: Camden is a well-known cultural neighborhood in north London. Known for its alternative culture, the crowds here are filled with goths, punks, rockabillies, and tourists alike. Camden has a vibrant body mod community, and you will find several piercing and tattoo shops in this part of town. London Eye: A trip to London isn’t complete without a visit to the iconic London Eye. Originally constructed to celebrate the millennium, the Eye is a giant Ferris wheel offering gorgeous views across the city. At night, the wheel is lit up in seasonal colors and is the centerpiece of London’s annual New Year’s fireworks display.

For instance, a company might be able to use big data to streamline its production process.', \"Sweet explanation and so inspiring . A big thank you. The answer is C. As for future impact, it'd undoubtedly impact every facet of life as voluminous  data continues to be systematically produced as more and more aspects of our lives gets connected(for instance: from smart homes, smart cities, transport systems, smart hospitals, airplanes to wearables etc) all generate huge data streams. As a consequence, it'll fuel manufacturing of more high end or super computers to handle the required fast processing demands we are witnessing.  Keep up the good work Simplilearn.
